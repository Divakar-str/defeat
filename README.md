## Abstract

Defect detection is an essential quality control procedure in the manufacturing process. Presently, there are numerous research implement defect detection systems for steel surface, fruit grade, or even if the concept of the smart factory also covers defect detection. The automatic system of fabric defect detection is common to use in textile manufacturers as it is difficult to recognize defects because of the obstacles like the very small defect area or intricate texture, etc. Therefore, human responsibility can not be the best effort for these problems. Furthermore, there has been a surge of interest in IoT and machine learning techniques application in the defect detection process due to their proven reliability. Defect detection now aims to be based on Deep Learning. Our project objective is to practice the fabric defect detection by using CNN, one of the famous deep learning models, to yield an intuition of the implementation and application of CNN. We believe that this knowledge will provide us a large benefit considering that Deep Learning becomes a key to an artificial intelligence system nowadays.
